The protosite was built using hand-coded HTML and CSS, with no frameworks or libraries aside from the jQuery dropdown and toggle menus.

                        <p><b>BACKGROUND: </b>On a two month project timeframe, student teams of two designers and two developers were tasked to design, build and deploy a live site for a real-world client. The site would be built on Wordpress using a custom, hand-coded theme and would include whatever plugins were needed to achieve the client's goals.</p>
                        <p><b>ROLES: </b>As the other developer assumed project management responsibilities, I became the lead developer on the project. This gave me the opportunity to focus more on AWS, Vagrant and Git and I ended up providing DevOps support to the team in addition to actively developing the template files. I installed, configured and maintained our staging server running Ubuntu Linux on Amazon EC2, established our Vagrant recipe, and learned to manage plugins using Composer.</p>
                        <p><b>APPROACH: </b>The organization needed a site with the flexibility to cover a variety of use cases, while being simple to administer and very user-friendly. They also had minimal existing brand assets, so we had to start essentially from scratch. We decided to implement a simple template hierarchy starting with Home, Gateway and Destination page templates, and added additional page templates as needed. This simplified design and development processes and provided a simple and flexible theme.</p>

                    </div>                          
                    <p><b>OUTCOME: </b>We were able to deliver a fully funcitoning protosite according to the project timeline. Using Vagrant and GitHub proved to be extremely useful, as we were all able to work on the project simultaneously with up-to-date files and without risk of over-writing each other's work. After the end of the course, I performed the site migration from our staging server to the client's hosted account on GoDaddy.</p>

                        <p><b>BACKGROUND: </b>As a course capstone project for the Web App Development series, our class was tasked with enhancing a partially-built application started by a previous class. This required first analyzing the existing code base, then working in groups using Agile processes to bring the app into a working state. The application was built on CodeIgniter, a popular PHP and MySQL-based framework that follows the MVC pattern, with a custom front-end built using Bootswatch.</p>
                        <p><b>CHALLENGES: </b>The existing code base was very incomplete and was split into more than a dozen different branches, with multiple versions of many files. The class was already on a shortened timeframe due to it being Summer quarter, and the first several weeks were spent learning the CodeIgniter framework as well as techniques to work effectively using a shared GitHub repository. This left us only a few weeks to actually analyze, consolidate and enhance the application.</p>

                    </div>                          
                    <p><b>OUTCOME: </b>By splitting into teams and using the Agile approach, we were able to consolidate the code and produce a working app with needed structure. I worked primarily on consolidating the controllers, performing code reviews, and helping to enhance the model files. By deploying a working instance of the application on my own development server and using GitHub's webhooks features, I was able to work effectively on various parts of the app as needed to support the team effort.</p>

                        <p><b>BACKGROUND: </b>Lauren Wilson produces small-batch artisanal ice cream in a rented commercial kitchen space and sells her product in small quantities, often by hand-delivery. Her existing website was not optimized for the kind of user experience she wanted to deliver, so she had resorted to using Facebook for her primary web presence. I offered to design and build a new protosite for her, which she graciously accepted.</p>
                        <p><b>CHALLENGES: </b>As this was also a project for one of my courses, I had to balance the needs of the client with the course requirements. The course was more focused on the design and prototyping process than coding, so I didn't have a lot of time to build the protosite and was not allowed to use any frameworks. This proved to be a challenging project for me as I was required to produce all of the design and branding assets which was not something I had previously focused on.</p>

                    <p><b>OUTCOME: </b>I conducted a comprehensive client interview and card sort to get a good idea of the client's needs and branding objectives. I was then able to develop an information architecture, wireframes, and produced several different design variations to give the client some options. Once the design was chosen, I had to produce a full protosite on a short timeline, which was done in HTML and CSS and then converted to PHP includes.</p>
